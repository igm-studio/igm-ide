## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

To report a vulnerability, DM Ransomware2#1600 on Discord. Avoid sending it on issues. Avoid sending private data, apart from debug
information. You'll get an update as soon as I can. If your vulnerability was declined, it's generally because I already know about it.
